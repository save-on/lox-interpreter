# Lox Interpreter (Work in progress)

This is the Java based implementation of the Lox Programming Language, following Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom.

# What is it?

Lox is a dynamically typed scripting language with a syntax similar to Javascript and Python. This project is an interpreter for Lox, which will consist of lex handling, parsing, execution and error handling.

# Current Status
- Lexer/Scanner : Done
- Parser : In progress
- Interpreter : To do
- Error Handling : To do

# Why?

This is a personal project I started out of curiousity. It's purpose is to provide me the deep understanding of programming language design and interpreters. I chose to write it in Java because: 

- The book uses Java making it easier to follow along, but also allowing me allocate more focus into interpreter concepts
- I want to learn Java and get comfortable with the language through a hands on project
